# falling-pipe-c64
A program for the Commodore 64 which creates the sound of the well-known falling pipe meme.  

Source code provided by the wonderful Jeff Birt - his GitHub will be linked here. https://github.com/Jeff-Birt

## What is this program for?

Novelty. It does nothing else but play a loud meme noise.



## What to use the program on?
A - Use VICE to emulate your Commodore 64.  

B - Create a disk and use it on genuine hardware. If you can get it to work, I'd love to see footage in my email - Please email me with footage if you manage to run this on your C64 at upiware@yahoo.com!

## How do I run this?  

Insert your disk into your Commodore 64. Once it says "READY", type in the usual command you would to run your games.  

```LOAD "*",8,1```  

Give it a moment to load, and once it says "READY" once more, run it.

```RUN```

### Your speaker should now play a loud crashing noise. Please contact me if it does not do this.
