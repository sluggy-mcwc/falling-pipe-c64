# falling-pipe-c64
A program for the Commodore 64 which creates the sound of the well-known falling pipe meme.  

Source code provided by the wonderful Jeff Birt - his GitHub will be linked here. https://github.com/Jeff-Birt

## What to use the program on?
A - Use VICE to emulate your Commodore 64.  

B - Create a disk and use it on genuine hardware. If you can get it to work, I'd love to see footage in my email - Please email me with footage if you manage to run this on your C64 at upiware@yahoo.com!
